---

Spearheaded by the [DoC EdTech Lab](https://edtech.pages.doc.ic.ac.uk/), Scientia is a platform that focuses on ehancing the remote learning experience for staff and students alike.

_ðŸš§ This platform is currently under development! ðŸš§_

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.X
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup

Please run `yarn install` to install the required node modules. In addition, please run `yarn prepare` to setup [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
