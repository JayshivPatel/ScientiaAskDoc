# Tech Stack

- ðŸ›  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing different Node versions [recommended]

- Node 16
- React & Typescript for the baseline
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for unstyled accessible components
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) for styling
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) for... well, icons
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management


# Running the app in dev

> Make sure that the project folder sits next to **Materials** project folder.

To make sure that cookies are sent correctly from the backend and stored correctly in the client, we use a docker-compose
stack with an Nginx reverse proxy (pretty much what we use in production -just with simpler configs).

```shell
docker-compose up [--build]
docker exec $(docker ps -qf "name=materials_api" | head -n1) flask load_dev_resources
```

The stack so-composed (pardon the pun) should allow for hot-reload in both Scientia and Materials (as the respective services' source codes are attached as volumes).

# Running tests locally

After `yarn install`, go for `yarn test`.
