# Scientia Project

> Scientia project - A central hub for the EdTech services that are focused on enhancing the remote learning experience for students and faculty alike.

_ðŸš§ This platform is currently under development! ðŸš§_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.X
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

If you already have a different version of Node, install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and proceed as follows:

```shell script
nvm install 14
nvm use 14
```

## Setup

First, run `yarn install` to install the node modules used for the frontend.
In order for the API links to work, the following repository branches need to be cloned and run separately:

### 1. materials@api

Clone *Materials*. 

```shell
# Clone the repository and checkout to the relevant branch
git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/edtech/materials.git
git checkout api
```

Follow the instructions in the [README](https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/edtech/materials/-/blob/api/README.md) to 
run the app on port 5000. Check that you meet the system requirements (near the top of the README) before attempting this.

### 2. emarking@api

Clone *Emarking*.

```shell
# Clone the repository and checkout to the relevant branch
git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/edtech/emarking.git
git checkout api
```

Follow the instructions in the [README](https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/edtech/emarking/-/blob/api/README.md) to
run the app on port 5001. Check that you meet the system requirements (near the top of the README) before attempting this.


### 3. scientia-calendar

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/zd419/scientia-calendar.git

# Setup and run the server on port 4000
npm install -g nodemon
npm install
nodemon index.js
```


## To run frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
