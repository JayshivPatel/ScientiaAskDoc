# Scientia Project

> Scientia project - A central hub for the EdTech services that are focused on enhancing the remote learning experience for students and faculty alike.

_ðŸš§ This platform is currently under development! ðŸš§_ 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

First, run `yarn install` to install the node modules used for the frontend. 

In order for the API links to work, the following repository branches need to be cloned and run separately:

### 1. materials@scientia-integration
```shell
# Clone the repository and checkout to the relevant branch
git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/edtech/materials.git
git checkout scientia-integration

# Setup and run the development server on port 5000
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt 
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_APP=materials
flask create_all
flask populate -r materials/mocks/resources.json
flask run
```


## To run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
